# About Me

Hi! I'm Ari. I'm a software engineer (currently [looking for work](https://arizerner.com/resume)) and often tinker on projects for myself, which I post here in the hopes that others will find them useful as well.

Recently, I've been especially interested in building with AI, which I think is the most important technology of our time. My most recent project (and the one I'm currently most excited about) is [JournalLM](https://github.com/ari-zerner/journallm), a tool for getting personalized insights and advice from Claude based on a Day One journal.

Outside of coding, I'm very social (mostly in Berkeley, CA), and my hobbies include Magic: the Gathering and cooking. I also write from time to time; check out my [personal website](https://arizerner.com) for my writing and more about me.

If you have questions, comments, or requests about any of my projects, want to collaborate on something, or just want to chat, please [reach out](https://arizerner.com/contact)!
